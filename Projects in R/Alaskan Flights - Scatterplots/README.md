# Hand in the HW1_Scatterplot_Project

For this assignment, you are to turn in all your files from the *HW1_Scatterplot_Project*.  So you will need to add the following files to this repository before pushing it back up to Github. 

- The 3 original R scripts you created: `scatter_normal.R`, `scatter_alpha.R`, and `scatter_jitter.R` 
- The `HW1_Scatterplot_Project.Rmd` file where you consolidated the scatterplots into one organized RMarkdown file.
- The `HW1_Scatterplot_Project.html` export file you created by knitting the above RMarkdown file.

After pushing these from RStudio back up to Github, be sure to surf to your assignment repository on Github and make sure your filles got pushed there. If you can find them there, then so can I!

Remember, you have to first commit changes to files or new files to the local repository (RStudio Project) before a push will upload them to Github.
