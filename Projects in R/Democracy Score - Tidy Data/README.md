# HW4 Tidy Data Project
## Modern Dive Chapter 4

This assignment repository contains an RMarkdown file named `MD04_Project_Tidy_Data.Rmd`.

Use `MD04_Project_Tidy_Data.Rmd` as a template into which to insert your code solutions and answers.

Follow these guidelines:

- Instructions for how to supply your answers are in the RMarkdown file.
- Knit it to a `MD04_Project_Tidy_Data.html` file and make sure your answers, code, and plots show up.
- The only files you should commit and push to Github Classroom are the RMarkdown and HTML export files.

After pushing from RStudio back up to Github, be sure to surf to your assignment repository on Github and make sure your filles got pushed there. If you can find them there, then so can I!
